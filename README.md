# Optical-Character-Recognition

Project Overview:
The repository includes implementations of different OCR approaches and image manipulation techniques, focusing on document processing and text extraction.

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Bounding Box | Notebook for detecting and drawing bounding boxes around text |
| Deskew Image | Notebook for correcting skewed/scanned documents |
| Image crop with Pillow | Image cropping using Python Pillow library |
| Image Preprocessing Using OpenCV | Comprehensive image preprocessing techniques with OpenCV |
| Image Rotate | Image rotation utilities |
| Key Value Text Extraction | Extracting key-value pairs from text images |
| Paddle OCR | OCR implementation using PaddleOCR |
| Paddle-Key Value Extraction | Key-value extraction using PaddleOCR |
| PYOCR | OCR implementation using PYOCR |
| Wand_Image | Image manipulation using Wand (ImageMagick) |

Features:
-> Multiple OCR engine implementations (PaddleOCR, PYOCR)

-> Document image preprocessing (deskewing, cropping, rotation)

-> Key-value pair extraction from documents

-> Comprehensive OpenCV-based image processing
